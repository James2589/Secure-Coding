# Secure-Coding
The primary purpose of this class was to learn how to handle multiple security vulnerabilties from buffer overflows to SQL injection. The projects in this course focused on creating a security policy and presenting said policy, this allowed me to learn how to research/locate current
security threats and find ways to eliminate the vulnerability within my code. Another big lesson from this course was the use of automation and static analysis tools to help find these vulnerabilites on top of manual reviews. While far from being an expert this course gave me practical
hands on experience finding and handling security vulnerabilies within existing code.
